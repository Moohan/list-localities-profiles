This is the code used to produce the Locality Profiles.

### Directories

- The code for Locality Profiles can be found on GitHub at [Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles). The latest version, which is mostly tested, will be on the `main` branch. The specific code used in each release can be found by checking the releases section.

- The code for HSCP Profiles is available in the forked repository [Public-Health-Scotland/list-hscp-profiles](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-hscp-profiles). This repository is maintained as a fork, allowing any relevant changes made to the Locality Profiles to be synchronised.

- Code for 'custom profiles', which are defined at boundaries other than Locality, is currently maintained on branches within the [Locality Profiles repo](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles). A few draft Pull Requests are kept open to facilitate easy reference.

- Both input and output data can be located on the stats drive at: `\\stats\LIST_analytics\West Hub\02 - Scaled Up Work\RMarkdown\Locality Profiles\`

  - Each chapter has its folder used to save input data before a release. The folders include: `Demographics`, `General Health`, `Households`, `Lifestyle & Risk Factors`, `Services`, and `Unscheduled Care`.

  - The `Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code\Output` folder is designated for saving all outputs.

  - The `Final Profiles` folder (and its subdirectories) is used to store completed profiles and related files that are ready for access by LIST colleagues.

### Files

Here are some important files and scripts to be aware of:

- **`Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/Global Script.R`**: This script loads the necessary packages and declares custom functions. It is sourced by most other scripts.
  
- **`Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/Locality Profiles Render Code.R`**: This script runs the analyses and generates the indicators, as well as creates the main profile and summary table outputs. It is the simplest and most effective way to produce the profiles.

- **`Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/Locality_Profiles_Master_Markdown.Rmd`**: This is the primary RMarkdown file that contains all the content for the profiles, excluding the summary table, which is generated separately.

  - Note that there are corresponding RMarkdown documents for each chapter. The contents of each 'testing markdown' should mirror the relevant content in the main RMarkdown file exactly. These documents, such as `Demographics/Demographics-Testing-Markdown.Rmd`, are useful for quickly testing changes to an individual chapter.

- **`Summary Table/Summary-Table-Markdown.Rmd`**: This script generates the Summary Table, which is produced separately because it is in landscape orientation, while the rest of the profiles are in portrait orientation.

- **`Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/make_sdc_output.R`**: This script creates the Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) Excel workbooks.

- **`Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/excel_output.R`**: This script generates the background data Excel workbooks.

## Running the Profiles

This section provides a step-by-step guide for running the entire Locality Profiles pipeline, from generating the profiles to moving the final files.

### Running the Main Profiles

The main profiles are generated by the `Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/Locality Profiles Render Code.R` script. This script can be configured to run for a single Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) or for all HSCPs.

#### Running for a Single HSCP

To generate profiles for a single HSCP, open the `Locality Profiles Render Code.R` script and modify the `hscp_list` variable to specify the desired HSCP. For example:

```R
hscp_list <- "Angus"
```

Then, run the entire script.

#### Running for All HSCPs

To generate profiles for all HSCPs, modify the `hscp_list` variable in the `Locality Profiles Render Code.R` script as follows:

```R
hscp_list <- unique(lookup$hscp2019name)
```

Then, run the entire script. This will iterate through all HSCPs and generate a profile for each locality.

### Generating the SDC Workbooks

The SDC workbooks are generated by the `Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/make_sdc_output.R` script. This script identifies instances where counts are less than 10 and saves the results to an Excel file for each HSCP.

To generate the SDC workbooks, run the `make_sdc_output.R` script. By default, the script will process all HSCPs. To process a specific HSCP, modify the `hscp_list` variable in the script.

### Generating the Data Workbooks

The data workbooks are generated by the `Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code/excel_output.R` script. This script creates an Excel workbook for each HSCP, with each sheet containing the data for a specific indicator.

To generate the data workbooks, run the `excel_output.R` script. By default, the script is configured to run for a single HSCP. To run for all HSCPs, modify the `hscp_list` variable in the script.

### Moving the Completed Files

Once the profiles and workbooks have been generated and checked, they can be moved to the final location using the scripts in the `final_copying` directory.

Before running these scripts, you must update the `year` variable in each script to specify the correct output directory. For example:

```R
year <- "2025-April"
```

The following scripts are available:

-   `Copy profiles to final folder.R`: Copies the main profiles to the final location.
-   `Copy SDC to final folder.R`: Copies the SDC workbooks to the final location.
-   `Copy excel output to final folder.R`: Copies the data workbooks to the final location.

It is recommended to run all three scripts in a single session to ensure that all files are copied to the correct location.

### Getting Help

This project is complex, and it is easy to make mistakes. If you are unsure about any of the steps, please contact the 'Locality Profiles cross team' for help and advice.
